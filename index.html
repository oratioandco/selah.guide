                    leading and giving detailed feedback, the next demanded
                    listening and asking thoughtful questions.

                            ancient device for human flourishing: a reflective

                            strength.

                    When leaders model presence and intentionality, it creates
                    "emotional contagion"—your team becomes more present too.
                    The result: more focused meetings, better decision-making,
                    and sustainable leadership.
