                        I was drowning in my own calendar.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As a design leader in the software industry, I found
                        myself in a work setup where I did not have full control
                        over my schedule. At least one day a week was full with
                        back-to-back-to-back meetings without a single break.
                        One meeting would require me to lead the conversation
                        and give detailed feedback, and in the very next one, my
                        best contribution would be to just listen and ask
                        thoughtful questions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Switching between these modes was hard. I was struggling
                        to show up as my best self in the next meeting context.
                        It was exhausting.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The "Shadow Calendar" Hack</h2>

                    <p>
                        Desperate for a solution, I put my designer hat on and
                        analyzed the situation and looked for solutions. I
                        realized that without an intentional transition I would
                        not naturally switch modes and continue to be present in
                        the next meeting in the same way as the previous one. I
                        needed a reminder to switch as well as some
                        self-coaching for specific meetings. I started creating
                        what I called a "shadow calendar." I'd add a second
                        calendar to my setup and create 1-minute events just
                        before important meetings. The event title would be my
                        coaching note to myself:
                    </p>

                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        This gave me a notification just before each meeting
                        with exactly the mindset I needed. It was a game-changer
                        for recurring meetings, albeit a little manual.

                    <h2>The Mental Cost of Attention Switching</h2>

                    <p>
                        Every time we transition between tasks, our brains have
                        to disengage, reorient, reload relevant information, and
                        suppress interference from the previous task. This
                        attention switching incurs mental and emotional costs.<a
                            href="#ref-1"
                            class="footnote-link"
                            id="cite-1"

                    <p>
                        But here's what's fascinating: neuroscience research
                        shows that brief, intentional pauses (brief mindfulness
                        meditations) can actually improve attention switching
                        and reduce stress.<a
                            href="#ref-2"
                            class="footnote-link"
                            id="cite-2"

                    </p>

                    <h2>The Ancient Solution</h2>

                    <p>
                        This reminded me of the Hebrew word from the Psalms:
                        Selah (סֶלָה). I remember learning about it as musical
                        notation to pause and breathe.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As I looked into it more I found even deeper meaning.
                        Modern scholarship discovered its function as a literary
                        device—a transition marker that creates intentional
                        pauses for reflection at crucial moments in the text.
                        The word selah occurs 71 times across 39 psalms, 3 times
                        in the poem of Habakkuk, and in two of the dead sea
                        scrolls where it was spoken aloud as a statement of
                        faith in times of distress.<a
                            href="#ref-4"
                            class="footnote-link"
                            id="cite-4"
                            ><sup>4</sup></a
                        >
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The psalms containing Selah share common themes of human
                        frailty, divine sovereignty, and the cycles of sin,
                        judgment, and redemption, suggesting that Selah
                        functioned as a reflection point on these existential
                        realities.<a
                            href="#ref-4"
                            class="footnote-link"
                            id="cite-4b"
                            ><sup>4</sup></a
                        >
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        What emerges is a picture of Selah as an ancient device
                        for human flourishing: a reflective pause, a brief
                        mindful meditation — silent or spoken — to process
                        life's tensions and meditate on eternal hope.<a

                    <p>
                        When we as leaders engage in intentional pauses between
                        meetings, we create opportunities for these Selah
                        moments—recognizing both our stresses and God's
                        sustaining presence. Peter takes it a step further and
                        to actively bring our burdens before God. To let them go
                        and cast them on him.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This act of casting our burdens requires the very
                        humility that Peter describes, the same humility that
                        makes us better leaders. It demands the alertness and
                        mental clarity that improve our decision-making.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The sacred pause becomes not just preparation for the
                        next meeting, but a moment to release mental and
                        emotional overload while finding renewed strength
                        through faith.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Building Selah: Automating the Sacred Pause</h2>

                    <p>
                        My shadow calendar hack echoed some aspects of Selah.
                        But I found myself wanting to add notes for any event
                        throughout my day—strategy sessions, design reviews,
                        even focused work blocks. The manual process was helpful
                        but limited.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The idea for the Selah app came from wanting to take the
                        manual effort out of my shadow calendar system while
                        adding features I desperately needed:
                    </p>

                    <ul class="story-features">
                        <li>
                            Full-screen notifications to help me catch meeting
                            starts during deep work (when I had do-not-disturb
                            on)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Flexible coaching notes that I could add to any
                            calendar event—not just recurring meetings, but any
                            moment in my day that could benefit from intentional
                            preparation
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Mindfulness practice options like a breathing
                            exercise to help with the actual transition, not
                            just the mental preparation
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        The app does something beautifully simple. Before each
                        calendar event, it gives me a full-screen notification
                        with a gentle animation: "now" → "breathe." Then it
                        shows me the upcoming meeting along with any coaching
                        notes I've added (or gives me the option to add one on
                        the spot), offers a 4-7-8 breathing exercise, and
                        finally presents a button that reads "I'm ready."

                    <p class="story-emphasis">
                        Sixty to ninety seconds of intentional transition. But
                        those seconds change everything.

                    <h2>The Science Behind the App</h2>

                    <p>
                        I already mentioned that brief mindfulness meditations
                        help with attention switching and reduce stress.<a

                            class="footnote-link"
                            id="cite-2b"
                            ><sup>2</sup></a
                        >
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The 4-7-8 breathing pattern is a well-known technique
                        for lowering stress. Its specific rhythm optimally
                        activates the vagus nerve, triggering the
                        parasympathetic nervous system. Within 60-90 seconds,
                        heart rate variability improves, cortisol levels drop,
                        and cognitive clarity increases.<a
                            href="#ref-6"
                            class="footnote-link"
                            id="cite-6"

                    <p>
                        The coaching notes feature addresses what psychologists
                        call "implementation intentions"—specific plans for
                        anticipated situations. Research shows people who set
                        these intentions are 2-3 times more likely to achieve
                        their goals.<a
                            href="#ref-7"
                            class="footnote-link"
                            id="cite-7"
                            ><sup>7</sup></a

                    <p>
                        The "I'm ready" button creates agency—the sense that
                        you're choosing your response rather than being driven
                        by circumstances. This activates the prefrontal cortex
                        and strengthens intentional action.<a

                            class="footnote-link"

                    <h2>The Ripple Effects</h2>

                    <p>The changes started small but compounded quickly.</p>

                    <p>
                        I began arriving at meetings more present and prepared.
                        Instead of rushing in with my mind still on the previous
                        call, I was fully there. My questions got better. My
                        listening improved. My stress levels dropped noticeably.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But the real surprise was how it affected my team. When
                        leaders model presence and intentionality, it creates
                        "emotional contagion"—the unconscious transmission of
                        emotional states. My team started arriving more prepared
                        too. Our meetings became more focused. The quality of
                        our design work improved.
                    </p>

                    <h2>A New Paradigm for Leadership</h2>

                    <p>
                        What I've learned is that the crisis of modern
                        leadership isn't really about time management or
                        productivity hacks. It's about presence.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We've created work cultures that reward reactivity over
                        reflection, speed over wisdom, efficiency over
                        effectiveness. But the research is clear: leaders who
                        can access their full cognitive and emotional resources
                        consistently outperform those who operate in constant
                        reactive mode.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The ancient practice of Selah, supported by modern
                        neuroscience, offers a different way forward. Not
                        slower, but more intentional. Not less productive, but
                        more sustainable.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What's Next</h2>

                    <p>
                        Selah is still a work in progress. Although we're just
                        getting started, I'm optimistic that this
                        straightforward approach can benefit not only individual
                        leaders but also help shape healthier organizational
                        cultures. The technology serves as an entry point; what
                        matters more is encouraging workplaces to acknowledge
                        both our limitations and our potential—combining
                        thoughtful self-reflection with practical,
                        evidence-based methods.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At its core, Selah goes beyond simply pressing pause.
                        It's about bringing greater presence and intention to
                        the way we approach our work and manage our time. In a
                        landscape where mindful leadership could make a real
                        difference, even a small step like this feels
                        meaningful.
